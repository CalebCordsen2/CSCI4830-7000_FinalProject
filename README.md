# CSCI4830-7000: Computational & Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Disease FinalProject
## Authors: Behzod Mirpochoev & Caleb Cordsen
### This is the repo for the code we utilized in our final project. Our final project involved predicting COVID-19 case data using different kinds of machine learning algorithms. This project was heavily based on heavily on a paper by Vahedi, Karimzadeh and Zoraghein called "Spatiotemporal Prediction of COVID-18 Cases using Inter- and Intra-County Proxies of Human Interactions". Included with this github repository is the csv file containing the data for this paper. No changes were made to this file but it is necessary to run our code. The citation for the paper and the data are below.
